# Windows 10 Pro Emulator

## Overview
Hi there. 😊 This is an emulator of the Windows 10 Pro version built using just HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (yes, no libraries or frameworks). I decided to build this cause I thought it would be a really good web app project and would help me understand JavsScript concepts more. Feel free to play with it! 😀

## ✨Features
* Automatic slideshow ✅
* Windows Menu bar ✅
* Drag and drop to delete apps ✅
* Functional date & time ✅
* Right-click sub-menu to create new file ✅

Background images gotten from Windows 10 Pro, using [Lockscreen as wallpaper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lockscreen-as-wallpaper/9nblggh4wr7c#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) app.
Svgs and images (most of them) downloaded from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), [icon8](https://icons8.com/), and Windows 10 (used the snip & sketch for the recycle bin cause the svg wasn't available online **hides in shame** 😅).

Thanks for reading! Have a nice day! 💛
